# 100 days of code with python

Welcome to my 100 days of code with python

On January 15th, 2021 I'm committed one hour, every day, for the next 100 days for python works.

## My Rules

1. I will push my works to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.

2. I will update my [Activity Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

- [Activity Log](log.md)
